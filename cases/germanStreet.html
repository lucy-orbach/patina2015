The rest of the painting has been cleaned. Removal of the surface dirt has greatly improved the appearance of the painting. Many details that were previously hardly visible became clear; the depth of the space re-emerged; the depicted time of day returned from a cloudy sunset to the intended bright noon. Because of its good condition, the existing varnish did not need to be removed.</p>
