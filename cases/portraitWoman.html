        <p>1. The painting before conservation. The painting with old, pronounced cracks had been glued to a cardboard in order to keep the canvas flat; its tacking edges had been cut. The unsuccessful attachment of the canvas to the board caused further raising of the cracks.</p>

        <p>2. The painting before conservation (detail). The raised edges of the cracks made it difficult to see the image. A thick, yellowed varnish keeps the surface stiff and brittle.</p>

        <p>3. The painting during conservation. The canvas was removed from the cardboard and the glue was cleaned from its back. The varnish is being removed. The canvas is relaxed and flattened as much as possible.</p>

        <p>4. The painting after conservation. Although the cracks (like wrinkles on an old face) will always remain visible to some extent, the flattening and cleaning allow the details of the sitter's face, her clothes and the earrings to become visible.</p>
